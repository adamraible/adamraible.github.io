    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi! I’m Adam Raible, a senior Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh with a minor in Computer Engineering. I have enjoyed bridging hands-on mechanical design with computer engineering work. Outside the classroom, I’m passionate about running, hiking, hockey, and spendiing time with friends and family. I am finishing up my coursework and will be graduating in August 2025, and am searching for new work experiences for the fall and beyond. This website showcases some of my class and real-world experiences, and will be updated with more soon!</p>
