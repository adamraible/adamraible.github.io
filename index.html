                <p>Hello! My name is Adam Raible and I am a current junior majoring in mechanical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. I have also met all requirements towards a minor in computer engineering, which gave me exposure to how other disciplines in engineering operate, as well as teaching me programming and other important computer-related skills.</p>
                <p>I grew up 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh in Cranberry Township, and went to Seneca Valley School district. I have two brothers who also went to Pitt before me, and both my mom and dad did as well. Growing up, I enjoyed being outside, playing soccer, and most often playing hockey. I would play hockey for about 11 years through my senior year of high school where I was an alternate captain for our varsity team, and also played on our roller hockey team.</p>

                </div>
                <p>At Seneca Valley, I also picked up a great interest in the maths and sciences, and knew I would eventually want to be some type of engineer. I got a start in programming in 10th grade, and took classes in it the rest of high school. At Pitt so far, I have completed five full semesters and one summer semester. The first two semesters being in general engineering courses, two semesters in fall 2022 and spring 2023 being focused on computer engineering, and I am now progressing through the mechanical engineering curriculum expecting to graduate fall 2026. When not in class I enjoy running, hiking, working out, and playing sports with my roommates.</p>

            <p>Worked on a team to design and simulate a k-truss bridge that can hold a minimum of 225lbs, built out of thin balsa wood. My focus on this project was primarily building the SolidWorks models in 2D and 3D, getting the necessary reactionary forces, and simulating the failure load.</p>

            <p>Worked in a group, and with other groups to complete an obstacle course where each group had to design and build a rover to go over their part of the course, and turn the next groups rover on while in motion. For this project, I helped design, prototype, and build a solidworks model of the rover and path. </p>

    <h2>Current Job: Transfigurations Landscaping</h2>
    <!-- First Subsection -->
    <div class="job-subsection" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;">
        <p>As of January 2024, I have worked for Transfigurations landscaping for almost 4 years, starting in June 2024. Working with this company, I have done a wide range of projects, such as building patios, retaining walls, and water features. The boss trusted me in my second year with the company to be our truck driver, and drove a dump truck around jobsites and supply yards to keep up with material needs. I was also trusted in multiple cases to teach new employees some skills on the job. </p>
        <p>The most important things I have learned working for this company are attention to detail and taking pride in my work. Any minor flaw in any of our projects could have caused a ruined patio, wall, and countless other flaws. Working carefully and paying attention was the only way to build things to last.</p>
