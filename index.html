    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi! I’m Adam Raible, a senior Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh with a minor in Computer Engineering. I have enjoyed bridging hands-on mechanical design with computer engineering work. Outside the classroom, I’m passionate about running, hiking, hockey, and spendiing time with friends and family. </p>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>I graduated from Seneca Valley High School in 2021 and began studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh before transitioning to Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering. I chose the minor to strengthen my understanding of embedded systems, programming, and hardware-software integration—skills that complement my mechanical background. I’m currently finishing my coursework and will be graduating in August 2025. I'm actively seeking new work opportunities for the fall and beyond. This website highlights some of my academic and real-world experiences and will be updated with more soon!

      <h3>Electromagnetically Actuated System to Demonstrate Fish-Like Motion</h3>
      <p>
        Worked in a team to develop a spine-like system to replicate underwater propulsion using electromagnetic actuation. <br>
        - Project aimed at demonstrating and controlling this magentically actuated motion
        - Goal was to show the motion, and how it could be applied to underwater propulsion for quiter, less detectable movement
        – Iteratively redesigned 3D components to meet dynamic movement goals<br>
        – Designed and tested PCBs with optical and magnetic sensors<br>
        – Debugged microcontroller, motor driver, and sensor integration<br>
        - Presented our final model and suggestions for the future to our sponsor and various engineering professionals <br>
